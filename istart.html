Once warm, add the Ashwagandha powder or root. Stir the mixture well.Let the mixture simmer on low heat for about 30-40 minutes.

Once cooled, strain the oil using a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove the Ashwagandha residue. Pour the strained oil into a clean, airtight container or glass bottle.</p>
